# Algorithms
Homework assignments and final project for my Algorithms Design &amp; Analysis class, following the textbook
[Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), taken in Fall 2013. Each assignment is included
in a seperate package file and is run via JUNIT tests.

The final project, *Puzzle Siege*, is exported to a runnable JAR file in the main directory for convenience. It is a twist on the match-3 genre
of my own design, in which you play against an opponent and build up an army to attack the other side.
